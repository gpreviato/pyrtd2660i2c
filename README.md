# pyrtd2660i2c
Realtek RTD2660/2662 programmer for Linux through I2C bus.
Based on ghent360/RTD-2660-Programmer and juancgarcia/RTD-2660-Programmer-Python.
This python script uses Linux SMBus I2C bus. You can program this chip for example with i2c-tiny-usb.


It can be buggy and it is quite slow! (>10 min to flash)
Anyway it works fine!
